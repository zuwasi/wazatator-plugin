description: Reviews an Agent Skill's SKILL.md with Wazatator's static readiness check and an LLM quality score (clarity, completeness, trigger precision, scope, anti-patterns). Use when the user asks how good a skill is, wants a skill reviewed, or wants it ready to publish.

# Review a skill's quality

Target skill directory: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, use the current directory).

1. Run `wazatator --version`. If it is missing, stop and point the user to the setup instructions at https://github.com/zuwasi/wazatator#installation.
2. Run the free static check (compliance, token budget, eval presence):

   ```bash
   wazatator check <skill-dir>
   ```

3. Run the LLM quality review through Claude Code (spends tokens):

   ```bash
   wazatator quality <skill-dir> --model sonnet
   ```

4. Summarize both: overall score, the weakest dimensions, and the specific lines in `SKILL.md` that cause them. Call out these check warnings when present:
   - `skill-too-long`: over 150 lines. Skills evolved in the WikiSkill study averaged 45 to 143 lines; move reference material to `references/`.
   - `low-level-steps`: many code blocks. In WikiSkill, low-level workarounds written for a small model cut a stronger model from 50.5% to 18.1% (negative transfer). State goals and constraints instead.
   - Missing "When to Apply" / "When NOT to Apply" boundaries: a common cause of trigger collisions in a crowded skill library.
5. Propose concrete edits. If the user accepts, apply them and re-run step 3 to show the new score. To prove an edit changes behavior, not just the score, offer `/wazatator:eval` with `--baseline`.
